# STAR FORGE Launcher

A launcher for **Star Conflict** that lets you keep several server setups side by
side and switch between them with one click. Each *server profile* carries its
own server address, replacement game files and code patches. Nothing in your
Steam install is modified; the changes exist only while the game runs with that
profile.

STAR FORGE is built by the [STARFURY](https://starfury.xyz) community (an
unofficial Star Conflict server), but it is meant for anyone running or playing
on a Star Conflict server project.

> **Status:** early development (0.2). It works for day-to-day play on Linux
> (Proton) and Windows, but expect rough edges.

## Features

- **Server packs**: a server hands out one link (or zip) with its address,
  game files and look. The launcher shows what a pack changes before
  installing it, and keeps it updated. Ready-made profiles for community
  servers are one click away.
- **Nothing touches your install**: a profile's files are redirected in while
  the game runs, so servers that change the same files never clash, and each
  profile keeps its own game data (store cache, notes, local server database).
- **Signed packs**: server teams sign their packs; the launcher remembers each
  pack's key and refuses updates from anyone else.
- **File lists**: servers can host their game files as a list (STAR FORGE or
  the SCMOD1 format other launchers use) and players download only what
  changed.
- **Client patches** (experimental): byte patches applied to the game's memory
  before it runs, checked against your `game.exe`, plus native plugins.
- **Linux and Windows**: on Linux the game runs through the Proton build and
  prefix Steam uses, with the Steam overlay. The launcher updates itself.
- **Command line**: `sc-launch` for scripts and for server teams' tooling.

## Get started

Download the launcher from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/starfury-xyz/star-forge-launcher/releases)
(Windows `-setup.exe` or `.msi`; Linux `.AppImage`, `.deb` or `.rpm`), start
it, and add a server under **Add profile**. Star Conflict must be installed
through Steam.

## Goals and to-do

**Profiles for everyone**
- [x] Server packs: import from a zip, folder, link or `starforge://` link,
      with a review of what the pack changes before it's installed
- [x] Pack updates from the server's published `pack.json`, checksum-verified,
      keeping the player's own changes
- [x] Warn when a pack was made for a different game build
- [x] Per-pack branding: the selected pack's logo, icon, background (one, or
      a random pick from a list) and accent colour; can be turned off in Settings
- [x] Background folder setting: a random wallpaper of your own when the pack
      has no background
- [x] Client patches: server-patcher patchsets applied in memory by the agent,
      checked against `game.exe` before launch, plus native plugins
- [ ] `sfp build` for x64 sources (today client patchsets are written resolved)
- [ ] x64 midhooks in the agent (C++-style hooks without a plugin)
- [ ] Let `files/` override members of `.pak` archives (the engine prefers
      packed files over loose ones; needs a VFS hook)
- [ ] Settle on patch methods beyond `inject` if needed
- [ ] Export a profile as a pack zip from the launcher
- [ ] Profile editor for patches and extra arguments in the UI
- [x] Pack signing: ed25519-signed manifests, key pinned per pack id on first
      install, pack code re-checked before every launch; `sc-launch pack
      keygen|sign|check` for server teams
- [x] Each profile keeps its own game data (store cache, notes, local server
      database); graphics settings and key bindings stay shared
- [x] Servers can require a minimum pack version before players launch
- [ ] Known publishers: ship server teams' keys with the launcher
- [ ] Shared core patch library that packs switch on by name
- [x] Packs can take their game files from a published file list (STAR FORGE
      JSON or SCMOD1), downloading only what changed

**Launcher**
- [x] STAR FORGE's own logo, icon and default theme (v1)
- [ ] Server status on the play screen (online / player count)
- [x] Launcher self-update via GitHub releases (signed; AppImage, deb, rpm, NSIS, MSI)
- [x] Theme picker with colour previews (was "Faction colour")
- [ ] macOS support (Proton/Wine path)

**Project**
- [x] Open-source release (MIT)
- [x] CI tests on Linux and Windows; tagged releases with packaged builds
- [ ] `cargo fmt` the codebase and enforce it (plus clippy) in CI
- [ ] Code signing for Windows builds
- [x] Guides for players and server teams ([docs/](docs/README.md))
- [ ] Contributor guide
